Then, it will send a message from initiator to receiver.

When the receiver receives a message from initiator, the receiver will reply with a message that contains the received
message concatenated with the value of its countSendMsg member variable.

The communication will end when both players send 10 messages which means that the initiator have send
and received 10 messages.
